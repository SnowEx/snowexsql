Raw Data Notes
==============

Snow Micropen (SMP)
-------------------

1. Two SMPs were used until they both broke. Identified in the data is a 3rd SMP
that is the an SMP put together from parts from the original two

2. SMP measurements have an orientation assigned. These are in reference to
their location relative to the pit. Measurements were recorded in crossing
transects aligned with cardinal directions and centered on the pit. N1 = 50M
from the center to the North. Its also the farthest out. In each cardinal directions
there are typically 3-5 depending on the sampling strategy.

3. There is a measurement log in the downloaded folder that has useful information
and is required for uploading these measurements to the database.

4. **The time from the original PNT files is not correct**. Please use the time
recorded in the CSV data


UAVSAR

Interferogram (.int.grd)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The data is a complex format. Each component is 4 bits (8 total). Set in a
standard real + imaginary j format. STILL DETERMINING WHETHER THESE ARE SIGNED
OR NOT (e.g. uint4 or int4)
