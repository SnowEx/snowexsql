Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

Types of Contributions
----------------------

Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Report bugs at https://github.com/SnowEx/snowexsql/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Fix Bugs
~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

snowexsql could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official snowexsql docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Adding Jupyter Notebooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project can always use examples of using the data from the database. To
add an example simply:

1. Create a new jupyter notebook under `docs/gallery`. Name the notebook
   `<your_project>_example.ipynb`. Note it must have the `_example` to be found by
   sphinx (documentation software).

2. Add a brief goal of the notebook and an enumerate steps list. Then use
   markdown `###` e.g. `### Step 1:` to demarcate each step so it shows up in the table of contents

3. After you have created/ran it, tag a cell with figures to make use of
   thumbnails in the docs. Those are:
                              * `nbsphinx-thumbnail`
                              * `nbsphinx-gallery`

*Note: you can assign these tags pretty easy by accident to other blocks simultaneously which
will break the thumbnail generator. If your thumbnail doesn't show up then check
which blocks had tags enabled*

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/SnowEx/snowexsql/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)
