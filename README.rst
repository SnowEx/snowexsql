About
-----
Database access and tools for using the `SnowEx database`_. This tool is
simply a client for accessing the database using python

.. _SnowEx database: https://www.github.com/SnowEx/snowex_db

WARNING - This is under active development in preparation for SnowEx Hackweek.  Use at your own risk.  Data will change as it is QA/QC'd and the end goal is for all data in this database to be pulled from NSIDC.  The goal is for this to become a community database open to all. 


Features
--------

* Database access for SnowEx Database
* Analysis tools
* Useful conversions to pandas and geopandas
* Lots of examples_

.. _examples: https://snowexsql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html


Installing
----------
If you are just planning on using the database, then only install the
python package instructions below.

I just want to use it
---------------------
Install using pip:

.. code-block::

    pip install snowexsql

I want data fast
-----------------
A programmatic API has been created for fast and standard
access to Point and Layer data. There are two examples_ covering the
features and usage of the api. See the specific api_ documentation for
detailed description.

.. _api: https://snowexsql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html

.. code-block:: python

    from snowexsql.api import PointMeasurements, LayerMeasurements
    # The main functions we will use are `from_area` and `from_filter` like this
    df = PointMeasurements.from_filter(
        date=date(2020, 5, 28), instrument='camera'
    )
    print(df.head())
