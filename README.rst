Database creation and management software for SnowEx data. The goal is to
create a single source (citeable) dataset that is cross queriable for snow
researchers.

WARNING - This is under active development in preparation for SnowEx Hackweek.  Use at your own risk.  Data will change as it is QA/QC'd and the end goal is for all data in this database to be pulled from NSIDC.  The goal is for this to become a community database open to all. 

Features
--------

* Database management for SnowEx Data
* Manage Site, Point, Profile and Raster Data
* Populate the snowex database
* Convenient GIS tools
* PostGreSQL Database end point for researchers


Installing
----------
If you are just planning on using the database, then only install the
python package instructions below.

If you are are database maintainers or installing it for the first time
follow the instructions below completely.

Mac OS
~~~~~~

First ensure you have following prerequisites:

* Python3.5 +
* HomeBrew

Then to install the postgres database with postgis functionality run:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd scripts/install && sh install_mac.sh


Ubuntu
~~~~~~

First ensure you have following prerequisites:

* Python3.6 +
* wget

Then to install the postgres database with postgis functionality run:


.. code-block:: bash

  cd scripts/install && sh install_ubuntu.sh

Python
------
Install the python package by:

.. code-block:: bash

  python3 setup.py install

If you are planning on running the tests or building the docs below also run:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

If you are using `conda` you may need to reinstall the following using conda:

  * Jupyter notebook
  * nbconvert

Tests
-----

Quickly test your installation by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  pytest

This will run a series of tests that create a small database and confirm
that samples of the data sets references in `./scripts/upload` folder can be
uploaded seamlessly. These tests can serve as a nice way to see how to
interact with the database but also serve to confirm our reproduciblity.

The goal of this project is to have high fidelity in data
interpretation/submission to the database. To see the current
test coverage run:

.. code-block:: bash

  make coverage


Documentation
-------------

There is a whole host of resources for users in the documentation. It has been
setup for you to preview in your browser.

In there you will find:

* Examples of database use
* Database structure
* API to the python package snowexsql
* Links to other resources
* Notes about the data uploaded
* Info on populating the database
* And more!

To see the documentation in your browser:

**Warning**: To see the examples/gallery you will need to populate the
database before running this command. Otherwise they will be left with the
last image submitted to GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash
