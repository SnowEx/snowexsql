"""
This is the main script for running ALL the database upload scripts.

Each script should have a main function that returns an integer number of errors
that occurred during its execution.

This script will rerun the create.py script which will prompt the user if you want to
overwrite the db. It will also attempt to rerun the resample/data prep scripts which
will all prompt the user whether they want to overwrite and rerun those scripts.

To create a new database upload script that is seen by this script, simply:
    1. Add a new file named 'add_<anyname>.py'
    2. Inside that file add define a main function that returns the number of errors
    3. To maintain data provenance, if your additionally data requires preprocessing (e.g. format conversion) create
    a script in this same folder, import it here, and then add it to the beginning around line 60 in this file.

Usage:
    python run.py
