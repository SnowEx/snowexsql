Ways to Contribute
==================

Report a Bug
------------

Find the *Issues* tab at the top of GitHub repository and click the *New Issue* button. Give your issue a clear title and describe the steps required to recreate it in as much detail as possible. If you can, include a small example that reproduces the error. More information and minimal examples will help us resolve issues faster.

Asking a Question
-----------------

Please do not create issues to ask for help. A faster way to reach the community is through our `snowex-sql Discussions page <https://github.com/SnowEx/snowexsql/discussions>`_. We are excited to have you join an existing conversation or start a new post! 

Write Documentation
-------------------

Found a typo in the documentation or have a suggestion to make it clearer? Consider letting us know by creating an issue or (better yet!) submitting a fix. This is a great, low stakes way to practice the pull request process!

Discovered a currently untested case? Please share your test, either by creating an issue or submitting a pull request to add it to our suite of test cases.

Add an Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Examples are a great way to show how to use snowexsql. If you have a use case that you think would be helpful to others, please consider adding it to the `examples directory <https://snowexsql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>`_.

Request a Feature
-----------------

The best way to request a feature is to file an issue at `https://github.com/SnowEx/snowexsql/issues <https://github.com/SnowEx/snowexsql/issues>`_.

When requesting a feature, please:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Let us know if this is something you would like to work on!
